# PathFinder
A project made for Java Computation course during the stay at Erasmus in Lisbon.

This is a simple Java application created to find shortest paths between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.

To run this application on Windows use Command Prompt, go to the project directory and run these commands:

`mkdir bin`

`javac -d bin src\main\java\app\*.java src\main\java\app\model\*.java src\main\java\core\*.java src\main\java\csv\*.java`

`java -cp ./bin app.PathFinder`
